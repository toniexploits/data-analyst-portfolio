/*
BigQuery project name is bigquery-newproject
dataset is cyclistic
tablename is tripdata-202103-202202

I had to combine datasets from each of 12 months Cyclistic data into a single table in BigQuery. 
Datasets from March 2021 to Feb 2022.

I ran the following queries to extract insights from the data.
